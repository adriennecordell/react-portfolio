        <h3>Celebrity Astrology</h3>
        <p>This project was created using an astrology API and an API that gives information about celebrities. These two API's came together to create an application that allows you to search a celebrity and see their astrological sign or search astrological signs and see which celebrities have that birth sign! </p>
        <p>This project used JavaScript, CSS, API's</p>

        <h3>Musical Chairs</h3>
